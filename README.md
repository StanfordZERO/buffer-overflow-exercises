How to:

First, run `$ git clone <repo link>` 

Then run `$ make` inside the directory

Run the server with `$ ./server`, and it will print the port it's running on

Run the client in a different shell with `$ python3 client.py localhost <port>`

Two people can share the same computer to play with each other. Or you can play by yourself :(
